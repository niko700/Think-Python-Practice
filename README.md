# Think-Python-Practice

Trying out answering some of the questions in Allen B. Downey's textbook Think Python 2 (2016).

This repo will contain code for examples given in the chapters, my answers to exercise prompts in the text of the chapters, as well as some answers to exercises at the end of the chapters.
